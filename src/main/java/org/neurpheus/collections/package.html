        Provides additional structures and utilities for collections. 

        <h2>Package Specification</h2>

        This package contains additional collections and utilities which are useful especially 
        for efficient processing and reduction of memory consumption. 
        <p>
            Thanks to the {@link org.neurpheus.collections.PaginationSorting} class you can get a small range of sorted
            elements (a page) without sorting a whole array (the Quickselect algorithm implementation).
        </p>
        <p>
            The {@link org.neurpheus.collections.array} package contains collections which stores primitive data 
            in compacted array using as little bits as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            The {@link org.neurpheus.collections.hashing} package contains structures which can be
            used to cache some objects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The {@link org.neurpheus.collections.tree} package defines an interface representing
            a generic tree structure. You can find two implementations of this structure:
            simple object based implementation in packgage {@link org.neurpheus.collections.tree.object},
            and compressed form provided by the {@link org.neurpheus.collections.tree.linkedlist} package.
            You can also find some utilities for the tree interface in the 
            {@link org.neurpheus.collections.tree.util} package.
        </p>

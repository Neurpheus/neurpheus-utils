<h2>Package Specification</h2>

This package contains classes which allow to create and use Dynamic Charsets. 
A dynamic charset allows to store a character in the form of a unsigned byte. 
This feature decreases memory consumption and speed up 
processing in some applications. {@link org.neurpheus.nlp.util.charset.DynamicCharset} 
class allows for registering a created charset in a JVM's enviroment. 
Registered charset can be used as any other standard charset.

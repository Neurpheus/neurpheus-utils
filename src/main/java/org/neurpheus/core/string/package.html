Provides useful classes which operate on character sequences.


<h2>Package Specification</h2>

{@link org.neurpheus.nlp.util.string.MutableString} class is a fast, compact, optimised, versatile mutable 
string. Any character in the mutable string is stored as a single byte in a backing array.
Mutable strings cosume match less memory then standard java strings.
More over, modifications like append, replace, insert, and so on, which are performed
on a mutable string, do not create new instances like in the standard java strings. 
If neccessary, backing array is increased. The mutable string can become 
compact (the size of a backing array becomes equal to the length of a string). 
See documentation of the {@link org.neurpheus.nlp.util.string.MutableString} class for more details.
